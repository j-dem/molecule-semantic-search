    "Background\n",
    "* A primary barrier to the widespread adoption of clean hydrogen fuel storage is discovering a practical material for Hydrogen Electrolysis.\n",
    "* At the current rate of materials science advancement, researchers project that the discovery and adoption of such an advanced material will take until 20XX[a].\n",
    "* However, climate change and pollution are occurring rapidly, so it is critical to accelerate this R&D timeframe to 2035.\n",
    "* The most significant barrier to accelerating this timeframe is the quantity of researcher toil required per cycle of advanced materials experiments because [order of magnitude][b] experiments are projected to be needed to make the necessary discoveries\n",
    "* The primary root cause of researcher toil is the human-inaccessibility of Hydrogen Electrolysis Materials Science (HEMS) experimental data.\n",
    "* HEMS experimental data is inaccessible because there is no widely adopted ontology for HEMS; thus, tens of millions[c] of HEMS experiments are stored in heterogeneous formats by thousands of materials synthesis labs[d]\n",
    "* We presume that HEMS data will remain heterogeneous without Practical Automated Ontologization for HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data due to intractable issues such as researcher turnover at labs.\n",
    "* Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich Department of AI and Data Analytics for Integrated Clean Energy Technologies seeks research advancements to commercialize practical, clean hydrogen fuel storage.\n",
    "* ValuestreamAI seeks a challenging, impactful engineering problem to solve.\n",
    "Hackathon Problem Statement\n",
    "* Automate the classification of non-standardized CSV headers to Node Labels compliant with the Proposed EMMO Extension Ontology for Hydrogen Electrolysis Materials Science.\n",
    "* Why we chose this subproblem:\n",
    "   * Alignment with the broader goals of the client research department\n",
    "   * Urgency for the principal researcher\n",
    "   * Impact on the principal researcher\n",
    "   * Estimated business and technical analysis scope smaller than 70 hours\n",
    "   * Estimated implementation scope smaller than 30 hours\n",
    "   * Representative of the department's larger problem set: Header Classification is a microcosm of the entire problem of solving the HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data problem.\n",
    "   * It is approachable enough for ValuestreamAI to upskill local engineers to do strong junior-level analysis and implementation in less than 150 hours.\n",
    "*   KPIs\n",
    "   * ValuestreamAI seeks to choose KPIs that are an accurate proxy for implementing Practical Automated Ontologization for HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data.\n",
    "   * Classifier Precision: precision of the classifier is paramount because a human user will distrust the inference system if they feel they cannot trust positive inferences\n",
    "   * Classifier Recall: recall determines the percent of researcher toil automated for the given subtask\n",
    "   * Runtime cost per million rows: determines the ongoing per-unit cost of testing and using the inference pipeline. Fortunately, this cost is exponentiating downwards due to an ongoing industry race to the top.\n",
    "   * Upfront R&D costs: the upfront costs. There should be an attainable cost curve for achieving useful milestones.\n",
    "   * Researcher satisfaction with deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Common KPIs considered but not included:\n",
    "   * F1 score: because we already include precision and recall\n",
    "   * Concept Drift Adaptability: future work\n",
    "   * Training time and cost: because we are starting with zero-shot techniques\n",
    "Solution Constraints\n",
    "   * The proposed solution must plausibly\n",
    "   * represent the larger problem of Practical Automated Ontologization for HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data\n",
    "   * scale to reduce a top category of researcher toil by at least 90%\n",
    "   * be adaptable to support high-quality integration with neo4j and VIMI\n",
    "Hackathon Proposed Deliverable\n",
    "   * Deliverable will be a Github repo including the following:\n",
    "   * Jupyter notebooks, including inference proof of concept, experiments, evaluation, and analysis\n",
    "   * A self-contained development environment for reproducing or extending the experiments\n",
    "   * Well-written documentation for relevant R&D workflows\n",
    "   * Up to three hours of recorded live technical deep dive sessions for the client research team\n",
    "   * Deliverable attributes\n",
    "   * Complementary to existing research work\n",
    "   * MIT license\n",
    "   * High standard of readability\n",
    "Payment Terms\n",
    "   * ValuestreamAI requests payment only if the deliverable meets or exceeds the client research team's expectations.\n",
    "   * NET60 from the day of delivery to the client research team\n",
    "   * Requested payment amount is the approximate cost of competition preparation and travel expenses, $4000 CAD\n",
    "   * Engineering hours are granted pro bono for this project.\n",
    "Future Work\n",
    "   * The proposed deliverable is only a tiny slice of the larger problem of Practical Automated Ontologization for HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data\n",
    "   * However, the ValuestreamAI team is in the early stages of understanding the broader context of this research field\n",
    "   * The next known subproblems are:[e]\n",
    "   * Defining the complete problem scope of Practical Automated Ontologization for HEMS Heterogeneous Experimental Data\n",
    "   * Inferring ontological relationships between heterogeneous data fields\n",
    "   * Investigating the potential for collaboration with other research institutions to pool resources and data\n",
    "   * Evaluating the effectiveness of the ontology in practice and making necessary adjustments based on feedback from researchers\n",
